This project is built around the idea that open-source isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving problems,
building tools that make a difference, and creating opportunities for developers to showcase their talents.
           I designed the platform with a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that it’s accessible and adaptable for different users.
Whether you’re a seasoned developer, a beginner, or an organization looking for talent, Pantheon provides the tools and community you need to thrive.
